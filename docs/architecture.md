# System Architecture - Experimental Build

DevOps Simulator follows an *event-driven microservices architecture* with *AI/ML integration, designed for **multi-cloud deployments* and *chaos engineering*.
*WARNING*: This architecture includes untested cutting-edge features.

## Core Components

### ## 1. Application Server (AI-Enhanced)
*Technology: Node.js + Express, **TensorFlow.js*
*Ports: 8080 (main), **9000 (metrics), 9002 (AI API)*
*Scaling: **AI-powered predictive auto-scaling*
*Intelligence*: Real-time ML inference
*Message Queue*: Apache Kafka for event streaming

### ## 2. Distributed Database Layer
*Primary*: PostgreSQL 14 cluster (5 nodes)
*Cache*: Redis cluster with ML-based cache optimization
*Configuration*: Multi-master replication
*Backup*: Continuous backup with geo-redundancy
*AI Features*: Query optimization, index suggestions

### ## 3. AI/ML Pipeline
*Frameworks: TensorFlow, **PyTorch*, Scikit-learn
*Models*:
  - Anomaly detection (LSTM neural network)
  - Load prediction (*XGBoost*)
*Auto-scaling Optimizer*: (Reinforcement learning)
*Training*: Continuous online learning
*Inference*: Real-time predictions (<50ms latency)

### ## 4. Multi-Cloud Orchestration
*Supported Clouds: **AWS, **Azure, **GCP, **DigitalOcean*
*Orchestration: **Kubernetes* with custom CNI
*Load Balancing: **Global anycast* with *geoDNS*
*Failover: **Automatic cross-cloud failover*

### ## 5. Advanced Monitoring & Observability
*Metrics*: Prometheus + Thanos (long-term storage)
*Logs: **ELK Stack + AI log analysis*
